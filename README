‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1.Save as fujizksy.sh

2.Make executable:

chmod +x fujizksy.sh

3.Run as root (required for firewall/process actions):

sudo ./fujizksy.sh

To use Crossover, usage step 1, 2 and 3 for script:

fujizksy_all.sh

üß† Notes

Works on Linux, can be adapted for FreeBSD/macOS (replace iptables with pfctl or nft).

Requires basic tools: netstat, ps, top, nmcli, iptables.

Add more commands in each section if needed (like nmap, ss, etc.).

4.To make the script cross-platform and automatically detect the operating system (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, or Windows with WSL), we'll need to adapt certain commands, particularly the firewall tools and network monitoring tools. I will integrate the necessary logic to identify the platform and switch the commands accordingly.

Here‚Äôs how we can enhance the script:

Linux: Use iptables or nft for firewall management.

FreeBSD: Use pfctl for firewall.

macOS: Use pfctl for firewall (similar to FreeBSD).

Windows (via WSL): We'll rely on netsh for firewall management and PowerShell for system commands.

I'll make the necessary changes to the script below, with platform detection at the start of the script.]
