# FUISKY - Fujizksy Security & Network Console

## Overview

**FUISKY** is a powerful and flexible **cross-platform security and network monitoring tool**. Developed by **asytrick**, it enables users to efficiently manage their system's security settings, monitor network traffic, and apply firewall rules. Whether you're securing a Linux server, a macOS workstation, or an Android device, **FUISKY** offers customizable options for securing your environment.

### Key Features:

* **Network Monitoring**: View active network connections, identify programs and PIDs, and manage blocked IPs.
* **Process and Resource Management**: Monitor CPU, RAM, and Disk usage with easy-to-read reports, and manage process forks.
* **Firewall Configuration**: Set and adjust multiple security levels (Basic, Medium, Hard) using built-in firewall tools (`iptables`, `pfctl`, etc.).
* **Security Hardening**: Disable unnecessary services, enhance system security, and lock down the device or network settings.
* **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, **macOS**, and **Android (with root)**.
* **Perl Integration**: Run shell scripts from Perl, enabling easy automation and configuration.
* **Automated Setup**: Simplified installation and configuration guide to help you set up FUISKY and get started quickly.

  * Ensure firewall management tools (`iptables`, `pfctl`, `nft`, etc.) are available on your system.
  * **Perl** or **Bash** for running shell scripts.
* **Android**:

  * Requires a **rooted device** or **Android WSL** for running system commands.
  * **Perl** interpreter should be available, or use Bash commands.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the **FUISKY** project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssmool/FUISKY.git
cd FUISKY
```

### Step 2: Build the Project

#### For **Android**:

1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Ensure you have **CMakeLists.txt** and **native-lib.cpp** configured correctly.
3. Build the project using Android Studio's build system.
4. Install the app on your device/emulator and press the **Run Script** button to execute the shell script from assets.

#### For **Linux/FreeBSD/macOS**:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the script directly:

```bash
bash fujizksy.sh
```

## Usage

### Running the Script

Once you have the application installed, use the following features from the interactive menu:

1. **Verify Network Connections**: View live network connections, associated programs, and the option to block IPs or kill processes.
2. **Verify Process Forks/CPU/RAM Usage**: View active processes, CPU usage, RAM, and disk stats, with the ability to kill processes or block IPs.
3. **Verify Network Usage**: Monitor system resources such as CPU, RAM, Disk, and network usage, with an auto-refresh every 10 seconds.
4. **Security Levels**:

   * **Basic**: Block ping (ICMP), fragmented packets, UDP packets, and block ports >553.
   * **Medium**: Block all ports, only allow POP3, SMTP, IMAP, DHCP, HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.
   * **Hard**: Deny all traffic, create a reverse proxy, and specify allowed ports.
5. **Lock Security Level**: Fully lockdown system, blocking all connections and killing all processes except the script.
6. **Leave Security Level**: Restore normal network functionality and re-enable connections.
7. **Hardening**: Disable unnecessary system services, apply security lockdown, and ensure minimal service exposure.
8. **Auto Firewall**: Automatically configure the firewall for common services like HTTP, FTP, DNS, and DHCP.
9. **First Install**: Setup and configuration walkthrough for new users, guiding them through setting up firewalls and security levels.

### Example Command:

On Linux or macOS, to manually run the script:

```bash
bash fujizksy.sh
```
